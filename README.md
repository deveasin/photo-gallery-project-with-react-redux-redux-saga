This is a photo gallery project using React, Redux and Redux Saga. I have used unsplash api for getting photos. 

> I have built this project becuase of Redux Saga. I think it's better then redux thunk. Hopefully I will use redux saga all of my future projects.

> You can suggest me about code improvments if you can. It will really help me and for this I will be greatful to you.
